For the moment, this is just going to be notes and gripes along the way.

** NPN/ALPN
- Chromium (and Firefox) recently dropped support for Next Protocol Negotiation (/NPN/) in favour of Application LayerProtocol Negotiation (/ALPN/).
- The app will run in at least node v.4.1, link against older versions of openssl which don't support ALPN. i.e. no ~h2~ for Chromium and Firefox
- Support forfor ALPN requires linking against Openssl 1.0.2k. which Node v7.5 is bundled with
- Thus in order to serve over ~h2~ to latest browsers, be sure to use Node v7.5
